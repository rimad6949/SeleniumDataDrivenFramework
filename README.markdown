# Selenium Data Driven Framework


### About Data Driven Framework

##### 1. What is a Data-driven framework for test automation?

* A Data-driven framework approach uses input data sets from various sources to execute tests. The framework separates the logic from the data which means the same test can be executed with different sets of data.
This approach can help increase test coverage reduce maintenance effort and improve testing efficiency.

##### 2. What are the benefits of using a data-driven framework?
Some of the benefits of using a data-driven framework are
- It increases test coverage
- Reduced maintenance efforts
- Improves testing efficiency
- Better scalability
- Better reusability of the test cases
- Faster test execution 

##### 3. How do you design a data-driven framework?
To design a data-driven framework, you should follow these steps:
- Identify the test cases that can benefit from data-driven testing
- Create a set of input data for each test case
- Define the test logic for each test case
- Create a test script that can read the input data and execute the test logic
- Create a test data repository that can store the input data sets
- Create a reporting mechanism that can provide insights into test results and test coverage

##### 4. How do you handle exceptions in a data-driven framework?
In a data-driven framework, exceptions can occur due to various reasons such as incorrect input data, unexpected behavior of the application, etc. 
To handle exceptions, you should implement exception-handling mechanisms in your test scripts. You can use try-catch blocks to catch exceptions and handle them appropriately. You can also use logging mechanisms to log the details of the exception and provide insights into the cause of the exception.

##### 5. How do you maintain a data-driven framework?
To maintain a data-driven framework, you should follow these steps:
- Regularly review the test cases and input data sets to ensure they are up-to-date
- Perform regular maintenance tasks such as updating test scripts, modifying input data sets, and updating the test data repository
- Monitor the test execution results and identify any issues or defects
- Continuously improve the framework by incorporating new features or enhancements
- Collaborate with the development team to ensure that the framework is aligned with the application's development roadmap.
